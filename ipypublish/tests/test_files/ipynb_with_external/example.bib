  abstract = {Non-toxic, earth abundant nanostructured semiconductors have received extensive attention recently. One of the more highly studied materials has been iron pyrite (FeS2) due to its many different promising applications. Herein, we report the thermodynamically-controlled synthesis of FeS2 nanocrystals, dependent on the reaction temperature and chemical precursors, and a Lewis acid/base model to explain the shape-controlled synthesis. The surface facet-controlled photocatalytic activity and photostability were studied and explained. This work further advances the synthesis with pyrite structure control and surface facet-dictated applications, such as photovoltaics, photocatalysts and photoelectrochemical cells.},

  abstract = {The structure of compounds with the perovskite structure ABX3 (A and B are cations, X are anions O2—, F—, Cl—, Br—, and I—), which are widely used in engineering due to unique electrical, optical, and photovoltaic properties, has been considered. Hybrid organic—inorganic halide perovskites important for photovoltaics of a new generation are worth mentioning; they contain cations of organic nitrogen bases as monovalent cations. A molecular dynamics (MD) study of the CaTiO3 base structure (Ca2+, Ti4+, and O2—) has been performed in order to develop the methodology of computer simulation and optimization of the shape and parameters of atomic potentials for perovskite systems.},
