A program for creating and editing publication ready scientific reports and presentations,
from one or more Jupyter Notebooks.

>**Attention**:
A major API improvement occurred in `v0.7.0`. This has not changed the
general user interface, but anyone using custom converter plugins will
be required to update them (see [Plugin Conversion](https://ipypublish.readthedocs.io/en/latest/custom_export_config.html#conversion-of-plugins-from-old-api))

For an example of the potential input/output, see:

Or, for a practical example of the ipypublish capability, see these documents on Atomic 3D Visualisation:

## Design Philosophy

In essence, the dream is to have the ultimate hybrid of Jupyter Notebook, WYSIWYG editor (e.g. MS Word) and document preparation system (e.g. [TexMaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/)), being able to:

- Dynamically (and reproducibly) explore data, run code and output the results
- Dynamically edit and visualise the basic components of the document (text, math, figures, tables, references, citations, etc).
- Have precise control over what elements are output to the final document and how they are layed out and typeset.
  - Also be able to output the same source document to different layouts and formats (pdf, html,presentation slides, etc).

## Workflow

1. Create a notebook with some content!
2. optionally create a .bib file and external images
3. Adjust the notebook and cell metadata.
4. install ipypublish and run the `nbpublish` for either the specific notebook, or a folder containing multiple notebooks.
5. A converted folder will be created, into which final `.tex` `.pdf` and `.html` files will be output, named by the notebook or folder input

The default latex template outputs all markdown cells (unless tagged `latex_ignore`), and then only code and output cells with [latex metadata tags](#latex-metadata-tags).
See [Example.ipynb](https://github.com/chrisjsewell/ipypublish/blob/master/example/notebooks/Example.ipynb), [Example.pdf](https://chrisjsewell.github.io/ipypublish/Example.view_pdf.html),
[Example.html](https://chrisjsewell.github.io/ipypublish/Example.html) and [Example.slides.html](https://chrisjsewell.github.io/ipypublish/Example.slides.html#/) for examples of the potential input and output.
