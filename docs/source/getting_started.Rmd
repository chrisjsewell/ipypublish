# Getting Started

## IPyPublish Basics

**This document is written in a Jupyter Notebook**
(or more precisely an RMarkdown version of the notebook),
which is executed and converted auto-magically to the page you are reading.
This is the power of IPyPublish!

```{python}
print("Hallo everybody!")
```

When analysing data with Python and Jupyter Notebooks, there are three 'modes'
we will be switching between:

- Writing and running analysis code (i.e. populating code cells)
- Documenting our analysis (i.e. populating markdown cells)
- Marking up and converting our notebooks to a distributable format

IPyPublish, in conjunction with some other great packages,
provides enhancements for working in each of these modes and the means to
seamlessly switch between them:

1. :ref:`code_cells`
2. :ref:`markdown_cells`
3. :ref:`notebook_conversion`

## Installation

Using [Conda](https://conda.io/docs/) is recommended for package
management, in order to create self contained environments with specific
versions of packages. The main external packages required are the
Jupyter notebook and [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org) (for markdown
conversion):

```console
$ conda create --name ipyreport -c conda-forge jupyter pandoc==2.6
$ source activate ipyreport
```

.. versionadded:: 0.9.3

    ipypublish is now available on Conda (recommended):

```console
$ conda install -c conda-forge ipypublish
```

ipypublish can also be pip installed into this environment:

```console
$ pip install ipypublish
```

optionally, to include install dependencies for sphinx exporters:

```console
$ pip install ipypublish[sphinx]
```

For converting to PDF, the TeX document preparation ecosystem is
required, in particular
[latexmk](http://mg.readthedocs.io/latexmk.html)), which can be
installed from:

- Linux: [TeX Live](http://tug.org/texlive/)
- macOS (OS X): [MacTeX](http://tug.org/mactex/)
- Windows: [MikTex](http://www.miktex.org/)

For helpful extensions to the notebooks core capabilities, see the
[Jupyter Notebook Extensions
package](http://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):

```console
$ conda install --name ipyreport jupyter_contrib_nbextensions
```

Additionally, a more extensive setup of useful packages (used to create
the examples) are provided by the [anaconda
distribution](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/packages/pkg-docs/)
which can be installed in to a new environment

```console
$ conda create --name ipyreport anaconda
```

## Basic Conversion

The **nbpublish** script provides terminal access to the notebook
conversion application. To see all the options:

```console
$ nbpublish --help
```

To see all the conversion configurations:

```console
$ nbpublish -le
```

or to see a subset of configurations with a verbose description, use a regex:

```console
$ nbpublish -le *latex* -lv
```

To run a basic conversion to PDF and auto-load it in a web browser

```console
$ nbpublish -pdf -lb -f latex_ipypublish_nocode path/to/notebook.ipynb
```

For a more detailed explanation see the
`notebook_conversion`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} section.

.. important::

    The default conversion (``latex_ipypublish_main``) will **NOT**
    output any cells that are not tagged with metadata.
    To output all notebook content by default, use ``_ipypublish_all``.

.. tip::

    For existing notebooks: the **nb_ipypublish_all** and
    **nb_ipypublish_nocode** converters (see below) can be helpful for
    outputting a notebook, with identical content to that input, but with
    default metatags defining how content is to be output.

The **nbpresent** script additionally handles serving
[reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) slides to a webbrowser.

```console
$ nbpresent -h
$ nbpresent -f slides_ipypublish_nocode path/to/notebook.ipynb
```

.. note::

    For offline use, simply download the latest version of reveal.js
    [here](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/releases), rename the entire
    folder to reveal.js and place it in the same folder as the converted
    .slides.html file. The slides can also be saved to PDF by appending
    `pdf-export` to the url (see
    [here](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#pdf-export) for details).

## Troubleshooting

For installation issues, GitHub Actions is used to automatically
test updates against multiple Python versions, for Linux, Windows and OSX,
Therefore, to troubleshoot any installation/run issues, it is best to
first look at the [test workflow](https://github.com/chrisjsewell/ipypublish/blob/master/.github/workflows/tests.yml)
and [test runs](https://github.com/chrisjsewell/ipypublish/actions)
for working configurations.

The
[requirements-lock.txt](https://github.com/chrisjsewell/ipypublish/blob/master/requirements-lock.txt)
file can also be used to provide exact versions of working package
dependencies.

For conversion issues, for both `nbpublish` and `nbpresent`, detailed
log messages of the run are output to both the console and file (default
path: converted/notebook\_name.nbpub.log). Try running with options:

```console
$ nbpublish --log-level debug --print-traceback notebook.ipynb
```

To debug PDF conversions, use the `--pdf-debug` flag. If there is still
an error, please raise an issue on the [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/chrisjsewell/ipypublish/issues),
including the run environment and the log file.
