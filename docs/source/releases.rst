Releases
========

.. attention::

   A major API improvement occurred in ``v0.7.0``.
   This has not changed the general user interface,
   but anyone using custom converter plugins will be required to update them
   (see :ref:`convert_from_old_api`)

Version 0.10
------------

v0.10.6 & v0.10.7
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Added sphinx option for toggling notebook input and output cells.
For examples see :ref:`sphinx_ext_notebook_toggle_in` and :ref:`code_cells`.

v0.10.5
~~~~~~~

Remove requirement for sphinx < 2.0

v0.10.4
~~~~~~~

Fix image reference clashes in rst files (see chrisjsewell/ipypublish#90)

v0.10.3
~~~~~~~

Minor Improvements to `ipypublish.sphinx.notebook`:

- remove ``sphinx.ext.imgconverter`` from sphinx auto-builds
- add additional known sphinx roles

v0.10.2
~~~~~~~

Update dependency requirements:

- Only require backport dependencies
  for python version older than their implementation
- use ``ordered-set``, instead of ``oset`` dependency,
  since it is better maintained

v0.10.1
~~~~~~~

Minor Improvements to `ipypublish.sphinx.notebook`:

- Formatting of the execution_count is now inserted by:
  ``ipysphinx_input_prompt.format(count=execution_count)``
- Use "Code Cell Output" as placeholder for output image caption

v0.10.0
~~~~~~~

- Added Sphinx extension for glossary referencing: ``ipypublish.sphinx.gls``.
  See :ref:`sphinx_ext_gls`

- Added ``ConvertBibGloss`` post-processor,
  to convert a bibglossary to the required format

- Added notebook-level metadata options for ``bibglossary`` and ``sphinx``
  (see :ref:`meta_doclevel_schema`)

- Large refactoring and improvements for test suite, particularly for testing
  of Sphinx extensions (using the Sphinx pytest fixtures) and creation of the
  ``IpyTestApp`` fixture

- fixed `tornado version restriction <https://github.com/chrisjsewell/ipypublish/issues/71>`_

Back-compatibility breaking changes:

- renamed Sphinx notebook extension from
  ``ipypublish.ipysphinx`` to ``ipypublish.sphinx.notebook``
  (see :ref:`sphinx_ext_notebook`)

- :py:meth:`ipypublish.postprocessors.base.IPyPostProcessor.run_postprocess`
  input signature changed
  (and consequently it has changes for all post-processors)

v0.9

.. code-block:: python

   def run_postprocess(self, stream, filepath, resources):
      output_folder = filepath.parent

v0.10

.. code-block:: python

   def run_postprocess(self, stream, mimetype, filepath, resources):
      output_folder = filepath.parent

**Handle Cell Attachments**

Images can also be embedded in the notebook itself. Just drag an image
file into the Markdown cell you are just editing or copy and paste some
image data from an image editor/viewer.

The generated Markdown code will look just like a “normal” image link,
except that it will have an attachment: prefix:

::

   ![a stick figure](attachment:stickfigure.png)

In the Jupyter Notebook, there is a special “Attachments” cell tool-bar
which you can use to see all attachments of a cell and delete them, if
needed.
